AVL Tree implementation in Java    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree    
All operations, worst cases always ```O(logn)```.    

Not thread safe.    
As described here:

Lookup is faster for large trees, here more than 15000000 elements.     

Still few debug functions - under development - but core functions tested and working.
